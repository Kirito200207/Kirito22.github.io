            <h3>Tweet Sentiment Analysis Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost Classifier</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on creating a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as positive, 
                negative, or neutral. By leveraging the strengths of CNN for text feature extraction and 
                XGBoost for classification, the system will provide an accurate and efficient method to 
                handle short-form, noisy, and diverse text data commonly found on Twitter. The project 
                will include research, development, testing, and validation phases.
